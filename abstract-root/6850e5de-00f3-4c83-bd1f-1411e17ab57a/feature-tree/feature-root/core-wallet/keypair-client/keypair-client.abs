# Keypair Client (Signing Wallet)

## üéØ Purpose
- To implement a full-capability wallet that signs transactions using a private key.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works
- Initialization
  - Constructed with a private key.
  - Derives the public account ID if not provided.
- Transaction Sending Flow
  - The `sendTransaction` method is the core of execution.
  - It gets a network client from the base class.
  - It sets the client's operator with its account ID and private key.
  - The Hedera SDK then automatically signs transactions upon execution.
  - It executes the transaction and waits for a success receipt.
- Transfer Logic
  - Methods like `transferHbar` build a `TransferTransaction`.
  - They then call `sendTransaction` to execute it.
