# PublicKey Client (Read-Only Wallet)

## 🎯 Purpose
- To implement a read-only wallet for public data queries.

## ⚙️ How it Works
- Inheritance
  - Extends `<base-client.abs>`.
  - Inherits all read-only logic like getting balances and account info.
- Initialization
  - Only requires a public `accountId` to be constructed.
- Signing Prevention
  - Implements all methods defined as abstract in the base class.
  - These include `signTransaction`, `sendTransaction`, and `transferHbar`.
  - Each implementation immediately throws an error.
  - This enforces its read-only nature at runtime.
