# Hedera Wallet Plugin

## 🎯 Purpose
- To register Hedera functionalities as discoverable SDK tools.

## ⚙️ How it Works
- Initialization
  - The plugin is created with a `HederaWalletClient`.
  - It then creates a `<hedera-wallet-service.abs>` using this client.
- Public Tool Registration
  - It always registers a set of public, read-only tools.
  - These include `getHederaWalletBalance` and `getHederaWalletAccountInfo`.
- Conditional Private Tools
  - It uses the `canSign` utility from the `<factory.abs>`.
  - If `canSign` is true, it also registers private tools.
  - These include `transferHbar` and `transferToken`.
  - If `canSign` is false, these tools are not exposed.
