# Hedera Wallet Service

## üéØ Purpose
- To act as an intermediary between plugin tools and the core wallet client.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works
- Initialization
  - The service is constructed with a `HederaWalletClient` instance.
- Method Mapping
  - Each method in the service corresponds to a specific tool.
  - Example: `getHederaWalletBalance` calls `wallet.getBalanceOfAccount`.
  - This decouples the tool definition from the core client logic.
- Logic and Safety
  - It passes parameters from the tool to the wallet client.
  - It adds logging and error handling for each operation.
  - It performs runtime checks for optional client methods before calling them.
