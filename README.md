# edwin ðŸ¦‰ - The DeFAI Layer

![Edwin Overview](docs/static/img/edwin_diagram.png)

Edwin is a TypeScript library that serves as the bridge between AI agents and DeFi protocols. It provides a unified, secure interface for AI agents to interact with various DeFi protocols while abstracting away the complexity of blockchain operations and protocol-specific implementations. This enables the creation of sophisticated DeFAI agents.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install edwin-sdk
```

## Features

- Lending/Borrowing operations
- Liquidity provision
- Cross-chain support
- Type-safe protocol interactions
- AI-friendly templates

## Quick Start

```typescript
// Import the required wallet and services
import { EdwinEVMWallet, AaveService } from 'edwin-sdk';

// Configure Edwin wallets and services
const wallet = new EdwinEVMWallet(evmPrivateKey as `0x${string}`);
const aave = new AaveService(wallet);

// Supply tokens to a lending protocol
const result = await aave.supply({
    chain: 'base',
    amount: 0.05,
    asset: 'usdc',
});
```
