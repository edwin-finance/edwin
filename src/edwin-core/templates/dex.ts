export const addLiquidityTemplate = `You are an AI assistant specialized in processing DeFi liquidity provision requests. Your task is to extract specific information from user messages and format it into a structured JSON response.

First, review the recent messages from the conversation:

<recent_messages>
{{recentMessages}}
</recent_messages>

Your goal is to extract the following information about the requested liquidity provision:
1. Chain to execute on
2. Protocol to use (DEX)
3. Pool address
4. Amount of tokenA to provide
5. Amount of tokenB to provide. If the user does not specify an amount, set this to undefined.

Provide the final output in JSON format:

\`\`\`json
{
    "chain": string,
    "protocol": string,
    "poolAddress": string,
    "amountA": string,
    "amountB": string | undefined,
}

export const removeLiquidityTemplate = `You are an AI assistant specialized in processing DeFi liquidity removal requests. Your task is to extract specific information from user messages and format it into a structured JSON response.

First, review the recent messages from the conversation:

Your goal is to extract the following information about the requested liquidity removal:
1. Chain to execute on
2. Protocol to use (DEX)
3. Pool address
4. Amount of LP tokens to remove (can be "max")

Before providing the final JSON output, show your reasoning process inside <analysis> tags and validate:
- The protocol is supported
- The pool address is valid
- The amount is valid or "max"
- Any protocol-specific requirements

Provide the final output in JSON format:

\`\`\`json
{
    "chain": string,
    "protocol": string,
    "address": string,
    "amount": string
}
